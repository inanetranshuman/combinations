Permutation/Combination Algos
* Permutation of a collection of elements is the list of all possible ways you can order the elements.
* Ex. [ 1, 2 ] --> [1, 2] [2,1]
* Combinations differ in that they ignore ordering.
* Ex. [ 1, 2 ] --> [1, 2] and [2,1] are the same combination, but different permutations.
* Num of permutations is n! factorial
